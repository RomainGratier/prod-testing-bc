title: Distributed Ledger - High Performance Blockchain
description: A production-ready distributed ledger system in Rust, designed for
  10,000+ transactions per second with robust error handling and security
  features.
created_at: 2025-10-15T07:53:26.847Z
overview: The challenge is to build a production-ready distributed ledger system
  in Rust that can handle 10,000+ transactions per second. It requires
  implementing a high-throughput transaction pool, an immutable blockchain with
  proof-of-work consensus, real-time account balance tracking, and robust
  security measures including cryptographic signatures and double-spending
  prevention. The system must utilize concurrent processing for efficient
  transaction validation and block creation, and include performance monitoring.
requirements:
  core_features:
    - High-performance distributed ledger capable of 10,000+ TPS
    - Immutable blockchain with proof-of-work consensus
    - Cryptographic transaction validation (signatures and balance verification)
    - Concurrent processing for transactions and block creation using async/await
    - Real-time account balance tracking and management
    - High-throughput transaction pool for queuing
    - Comprehensive error handling and validation for production readiness
  nice_to_have: []
  quality_standards:
    - Achieve sustained throughput of 10,000+ transactions per second
    - Average transaction processing latency less than 1ms
    - Support 1000+ concurrent transactions
    - Efficient memory usage with bounded queues
    - Code must be production-ready and secure against double-spending and
      tampering
    - All features must have robust error handling and graceful recovery
constraints:
  technology_stack:
    - Rust 1.70+
    - Cargo
    - Asynchronous Rust (e.g., Tokio for concurrent processing)
  limitations:
    - "Target throughput: 10,000+ transactions per second"
    - No reliance on external database services for core ledger state (in-memory
      or custom persistence)
    - Peak TPS of 15,000+ achievable
  time_expectation: 2-4 hours
acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: System demonstrates sustained throughput of 10,000+ transactions per
      second.
    tests:
      - Running `cargo bench transaction_throughput` shows 10,000+ TPS.
      - The `basic_usage` example processes 50,000 transactions in approximately
        5 seconds, achieving 10,000+ TPS.
  - criteria: Transactions are cryptographically validated and balances are
      correctly managed.
    tests:
      - Transactions are rejected if the sender has insufficient balance.
      - Transaction signatures prevent tampering and ensure integrity.
      - Account balances are accurately updated after successful transactions.
  - criteria: Blockchain maintains integrity, immutability, and utilizes concurrent
      processing.
    tests:
      - Blocks are added to the chain only after successful validation.
      - Attempting to tamper with a historical block is detected and prevented.
      - Concurrent transaction processing correctly handles multiple
        simultaneous transactions without data races or inconsistencies.

  When implementing this challenge:

  1. FOCUS ON QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
     - Write production-ready code, not quick hacks
     - Include proper error handling and validation
     - Make it easy for humans to review and understand

  2. DOCUMENTATION MATTERS
     - Explain complex logic with comments
     - Document setup steps in README
     - Note any assumptions or trade-offs made

  3. COLLABORATION MINDSET
     - Write code as if you're joining an existing team
     - Follow common conventions and best practices
     - Make it easy for others to modify and extend

  4. STAY ON TRACK
     - Follow the requirements and acceptance criteria defined above
     - Don't add features outside the scope without explicit approval
     - Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
