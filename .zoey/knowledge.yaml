  When implementing this challenge:
  
  1. FOCUS ON QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
     - Write production-ready code, not quick hacks
     - Include proper error handling and validation
     - Make it easy for humans to review and understand
  
  2. DOCUMENTATION MATTERS
     - Explain complex logic with comments
     - Document setup steps in README
     - Note any assumptions or trade-offs made
  
  3. COLLABORATION MINDSET
     - Write code as if you're joining an existing team
     - Follow common conventions and best practices
     - Make it easy for others to modify and extend
  
  4. STAY ON TRACK
     - Follow the requirements and acceptance criteria defined above
     - Don't add features outside the scope without explicit approval
     - Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
